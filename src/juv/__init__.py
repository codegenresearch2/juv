To address the issue of the build process for the package `juv` failing due to the inability to determine which files to include in the wheel distribution, we need to explicitly define the files or directories to be included in the wheel package. This can be done by adding a `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` section in the project's configuration file (e.g., `pyproject.toml`). Here is an example configuration that includes the necessary settings:\"\"\"toml\[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]\"\""
